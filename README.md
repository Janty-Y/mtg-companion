A Magic: The Gathering life and match history tracker

This app was inspired from my days of playing Magic: The Gathering with my friends.
At the time, we used to use an app that was just a simple life tracker, and a whiteboard to keep track of matches won.
The idea of this app was to integrate those features, along with a timer and deck names, in a concise and easy to use app.

One of the rules for creating this was I did not want to use any popular framework, and I wanted to use JQuery to become more comfortable with it.

This app was created with:
-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
-BootStrap 5
-FontAwesome
-Jquery

The idea being that I wanted this to be somewhat barebones while still achieving the goal that I set out for. 

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to reach out to me or leave a comment on the issues section!

Thank you so much for having a look.
